this script tool take a resource file of strings and create a converter class to make avalible to binding to it with a dinamyc key.

for example. if a "textbox.Text" is binding to a string property and the binding use the generated converter then the output will be the content of the resource file that the key match with the real string that the property has. otherwise is empty.string.

the arguments for the command line interface are all positional and they are.

[argument 0] = the resource file absolute path
[argument 1] = the output file absolute path for the converter  
[argument 2] = the namespace for the generated class
[argument 3] = the full name of the autogenerated resource file. with namespace included

example:
ResourceDynamicConverterCreator.py "C:\Proyectos C#\EnadlaInventory\EnadlaInventory.UI\Strings\CodeErrorMessages.resx" "C:\Proyectos C#\EnadlaInventory\EnadlaInventory.UI\Helpers\Mvvm\ErrorCodeMessagesKeyConverter.cs" "EnadlaInventory.UI.Helpers.Mvvm" "EnadlaInventory.UI.Strings.CodeErrorMessages"

## Remarks

the scripts saves in cache a hash for the input resource file and a hash for the generated converter. so if try to generate again an the hash matches then the scripts will not to generate nothing.

if the template for the scripts change but was generated before and you try to generate again will not generate nothing because the input file and the output file are cached. so you will have to delete or modificate the output file to generate again.
